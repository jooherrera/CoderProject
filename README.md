### <u> NodeJS</u> :heavy_check_mark: 

Please see the appropiate guide for your environment.

https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#windows

### NPM :heavy_check_mark:
npm is distributed with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)- which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get 
npm installed on your computer.

#### Check that you have node and npm installed

To check if you have Node.js installed, run this command in your terminal:

```
node -v
```
To confirm that you have npm installed you can run this command in your terminal:

```
npm -v
```
#### Update npm


npm is a separate project from Node.js, and tends to update more frequently. As a result, even if you’ve just downloaded 
Node.js (and therefore npm), you’ll probably need to update your npm. Luckily, npm knows how to update itself! To update 
your npm, type this into your terminal:

```
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### TypeScript :heavy_check_mark:


You can install TypeScript via npm

```
npm install typescript -g
```


### Sass :heavy_check_mark:

You can install Sass via npm

```
npm install -g sass
```

### http-server :heavy_check_mark:

You can install http-server via npm

```
npm install http-server -g
```
